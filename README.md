===============

Custom Geany Templates not distributed with Geany itself. You can clone this
repository somewhere in your $HOME and point a symbolic link named
~/.config/geany/templates to it. Restart Geany and have fun.


There are several template files in this directory. For these templates you can
use wildcards. For more information read the documentation (in
/usr/share/doc/geany/html/index.html or visit http://www.geany.org/).
